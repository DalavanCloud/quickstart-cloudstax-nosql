## CloudStax NoSQL DB for Apache Casssandra on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically deploys CloudStax NoSQL DB for Apache Cassandra into a highly available architecture on AWS, using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) for container orchestration and CloudStax FireCamp for stateful service management.

CloudStax NoSQL DB for Cassandra removes the complexity associated with deploying and managing Apache Cassandra. It provides a high-performance, highly scalable, and cost-effective NoSQL database that you can use to manage large amounts of data.

Deploying CloudStax NoSQL DB on AWS helps enhance the reliability of using Cassandra for your production deployments. This Quick Start uses multiple Availability Zones for high availability, automatic failure detection, and recovery of Cassandra nodes, and helps provide enhanced security and isolation for Cassandra.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying CloudStax NoSQL DB into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying CloudStax NoSQL DB into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
